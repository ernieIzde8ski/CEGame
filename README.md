# CEGame

Program(s?) written in C++ for the TI-84 Plus CE calculator. Should
also work with the TI-83 CE calculator, but I don't own one.

## Requirements

This project is built with the [CE C/C++ toolchain](https://ce-programming.github.io/toolchain/index.html)
on Linux. Install it and add its /bin to $PATH before running `make`
in a /src/ directory. The CE Libraries (found under CE Library
Headers) are likewise required.
